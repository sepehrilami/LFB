      "poolparty   As Alex, my chosen donation is 5. I believe that contributing $5 will give me the best chance of achieving a successful and enjoyable party, while also taking into account the potential contributions of Taylor, Jordan, and Casey. By choosing a moderate amount, I can balance the risk of under- or over-contribution, while still maintaining the possibility of receiving a higher multiplier from the university. Additionally, this donation amount allows me to maintain a decent level of control over the outcome, as it is not too high or too low compared to the potential contributions of my peers. Ultimately, my goal is to maximize my own enjoyment from the party, while also being mindful of the potential contributions of the other three residents in our dorm.\n",
