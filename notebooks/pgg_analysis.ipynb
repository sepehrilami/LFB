I believe that contributing $5 will provide a good balance between enjoying the party and also ensuring that the total amount contributed is sufficient to make the event enjoyable for everyone. While contributing more than half of my initial budget may seem risky without knowing the contributions of the other residents, I believe that the multiplier effect of the university's offer can help offset any potential risks.
